    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Look no further—this is the only lemon cheesecake recipe you’ll ever make
      again. Savor every sweet-tart taste of the creamiest, dreamiest cheesecake
      flavored with fresh lemon, nestled between a buttery graham cracker crust
      and a layer of homemade lemon curd. Top with clouds of fluffy whipped
      cream and sunny lemon slices for a simple yet eye-catching presentation.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 and 3/4 cups (210g) graham cracker crumbs (about 14 full-sheet graham
        crackers)
      </li>
      <li>5 Tablespoons (71g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cheesecake</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 and 1/4 cups (250g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon packed lemon zest (about 1 lemon)</li>
      <li>
        32 ounces (904g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room
        temperature
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup (120ml) fresh lemon juice (about 3-4 lemons), at room
        temperature
      </li>
      <li>1/3 cup (80g) sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup lemon curd (highly recommended)</li>
      <li>homemade whipped cream</li>
      <li>lemon slices and/or fresh berries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to
        350°F (177°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the crust: If you’re starting out with full graham crackers, use a
        food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a
        medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in the
        melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and
        slightly up the sides of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Pat down
        until the mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly; you can use the flat
        bottom of a small measuring cup to help smooth it out if needed.
        Pre-bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a
        large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the
        water bath in step 6. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the
        filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the lemon sugar: Place sugar in your food processor or blender.
        Spoon lemon zest on top. Pulse/blend until the two are blended and the
        lemon zest is slightly broken down, about 10-12 pulses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue with the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a
        paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and lemon sugar together on
        medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and
        creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice, sour cream, and vanilla
        extract, then beat on medium-high speed until fully combined. On medium
        speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until
        just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
        mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it
        cools, avoid over-mixing the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour cheesecake batter into warm crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to
        smooth it into an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the simple water bath: Boil a kettle/pot of water. You need 1
        inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you
        boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. Place the pan inside
        of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan
        and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven
        first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Time-saving tip: If topping with lemon curd, which I highly recommend,
        make the curd on the stove as the cheesecake bakes, so it has time to
        cool before using in step 10.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake cheesecake for 55–70 minutes or until the center is almost set.
        (Note: if you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top, tent it
        with aluminum foil halfway through baking.) When it’s done, the center
        of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently tap the pan. Turn
        the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in
        the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, lift out of the water bath, then cool uncovered
        cheesecake completely at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with lemon curd: After cheesecake has cooled completely at room
        temperature, spread about 3/4 cup of lemon curd (around 1/2 of the curd
        recipe) on top, nearing the edge of the cheesecake without spilling
        over. I use an offset spatula to spread.
      </li>
      <li>Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
      <li>
        Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
        springform pan, then remove the rim. Add more garnishes like whipped
        cream, lemon slices, and berries, if desired. Using a clean sharp knife,
        cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and
        dip into warm water between each slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5
        days.
      </li>
